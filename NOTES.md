- correlation (an event happens in concert with others)
- induction (find a pattern from facts)
- deduction (create hypothetical fakt from pattern)
- forecast (given some facts, what happens next?)
- generation (generate information from patterns)
- by analogy (apply a pattern on similar information)
- causality (classify if a pattern is correlation or causality)
- complete knowledge (given some facts, find patterns, ask for information needed to perfect patterns)

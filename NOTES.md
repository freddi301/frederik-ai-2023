# Concepts

- associative memory (recalling a knowledge links to other)
- correlation (an event happens in concert with others)
- induction (find a pattern from facts)
- deduction (create hypothetical fact from pattern)
- forecast (given some facts, what happens next?)
- generation (generate information from patterns)
- by analogy (apply a pattern on similar information)
- causality (classify if a pattern is correlation or causality)
- scientific method (given some facts, find patterns, ask for information needed to perfect patterns)
- classification (find out similar sets of events has same consequence)

# Tasks

- translation (english language -> agnostic language -> italian language)
- complete text
- summarize text
- query (get knowledge -> select and rearrange it based on a query)
- forecast event (given some events -> what happens next?)
